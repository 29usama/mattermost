Mattermost Docker Deployment and Backup Management
Overview

This document provides an overview of the Mattermost deployment using Docker, along with the backup strategy for the PostgreSQL database and file storage. It includes instructions on setting permissions, running the backup script, and managing backups.
Mattermost Deployment

Mattermost is deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. The service consists of a Mattermost application container (app) and a PostgreSQL database container (db).
Configuration

    Docker and Docker Compose are used for orchestration.
    docker-compose.yml contains the configuration for the Mattermost and PostgreSQL services.
    Mattermost data is stored in ./volumes/app/mattermost/.
    PostgreSQL data is stored in ./volumes/db/.

Permissions

To ensure proper permissions for the Mattermost directories, the following command is used:

bash

sudo chown -R 2000:2000 ./volumes/app/mattermost

This command sets the ownership of the Mattermost volumes to the user ID 2000, which is typically used within the Mattermost Docker container.
Backup Strategy

A backup strategy is implemented to secure the PostgreSQL database and Mattermost data.
PostgreSQL Backup

    backup.sh: A script to backup the PostgreSQL database.
    Backups are stored in the backups/ directory.
    The script creates a new backup file and removes backups older than 7 days.

Running the Backup Script

To execute the backup script, run:

bash

./backup.sh

This script should be scheduled to run regularly using a cron job.
Backup Script Contents

The backup.sh script performs the following actions:

    Dumps the PostgreSQL database.
    Stores the dump in the backups/ directory with a timestamp.
    Removes database dumps older than 7 days.

Cron Job Setup

The backup script can be scheduled to run daily at a specific time using a cron job. To set up the cron job, edit the crontab file:

bash

crontab -e

Add a line following the cron format. For example, to run the script every day at 2 AM:

bash

0 2 * * * /path/to/backup.sh

Important Notes

    Regularly test the backup and restore process to ensure data integrity.
    Securely transfer and store backup files, especially when migrating to a new server.
    Keep the Mattermost and PostgreSQL software updated to the latest stable versions.
    Review Mattermost and PostgreSQL logs periodically for any unusual activity or errors.


/root/docker-projects/mattermost/volumes/app/mattermost/config
at this path you need verify the credentials etc or updates

"DataSource": "postgres://mmuser:mmuser_password@db/mattermost?sslmode=disable\u0026connect_timeout=10\u0026binary_parameters=yes",

/root/docker-projects/mattermost/volumes/db
at this  you need make sure postgresql.conf

/root/docker-projects/mattermost/volumes/db/var/lib/postgresql/data
you need edit  pg_hba.conf if entry not allowed on some ip

docker exec -it [CONTAINER_NAME] bash

createdb -U [USERNAME] [DBNAME]

sometime need create database aswell
